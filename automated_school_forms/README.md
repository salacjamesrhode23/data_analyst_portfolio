## Automated School Form v.1.0

**Role:** Special Science Teacher | Admin Support - Excel Automation<br>
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables) | VBA and Macros

### 🔍 Problem  
At the end of each semester, senior high school class advisers face significant challenges in completing student forms, particularly report cards and permanent records. The manual process takes weeks, requiring advisers to input data across multiple forms and manually cross-check for errors. This method is repetitive, time-consuming, and highly prone to human error.  

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop an Excel-based solution for preparing school forms  
- Automate repetitive tasks from data entry to printing  
- Eliminate errors in student records across all forms  

### ⚙️ Solution Approach

**Data Entry:** <br>
- Enforces consistency across worksheets, primarily used excel table with data validation to restrict input types (example: dropdown list to limit choices or numeric to only allow numeric values), also includes prompts and error messages to guide users. 

**Automation:** <br>
- Combination of both Macro recording and VBA scripts used to develop a VBA project . These scripts are attached to objects (buttons) automating repetitive task such as page navigation, saving copies, printing, etc.

**Excel Formulas:** <br>
Some of the formulas used in the project:
- **Lookup Functions** (particularly **INDEX-MATCH**) – retrieves data from any column into report cards and permanent records.
- **Calculated Columns** – derives information for each student by performing calculations between columns, used in text concatenation and date/time calculations.
- **Aggregate Calculations** – summarize or combine data from multiple rows, commonly for KPIs such as total absences or student GPA.
- **Logical Calculations** – return results based on logical tests, typically for remarks such as *Pass* or *Fail*.

### 📈 Key Results

✅Streamlined school form preparation using Excel/VBA, reducing processing time from one week to less than a day <br>
✅Eliminated 100% of data-entry errors, removing the need for manual cross-checks.<br>
✅Delivered a practical, easy-to-use solution adopted by senior high school advisers for two consecutive school years.
