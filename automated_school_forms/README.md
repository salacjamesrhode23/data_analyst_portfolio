## Automated School Form v.1.0

**Role:** Special Science Teacher | Admin Support - Excel Automation<br>
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables) | VBA and Macros

### üîç Problem  
At the end of each semester, senior high school class advisers face significant challenges in completing student forms, particularly report cards and permanent records. The manual process takes weeks, requiring advisers to input data across multiple forms and manually cross-check for errors. This method is repetitive, time-consuming, and highly prone to human error.  

### üéØ Objectives  
- Develop an Excel-based solution for preparing school forms  
- Automate repetitive tasks from data entry to printing  
- Eliminate errors in student records across all forms  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Approach

**Data Entry and Validation:** <br>
Excel tables were primarily used for data entry. To validate and standardize data formats and avoid errors, dropdown menus, input messages, and error alerts were included.

**Automation:** <br>
A combination of Macro recording and VBA scripts is used to automate repetitive tasks. These scripts is attached to objects (buttons) performing functions such as page navigation, saving copies, printing, etc.

**Excel Formulas:** <br>
The most common formulas used in this project include:

- **Lookup Functions** (particularly **INDEX-MATCH**) ‚Äì used to retrieve data from any column into report cards and permanent records.

- **Calculated Columns** ‚Äì used to derive information for each student by performing calculations between columns; also applied in text concatenation and date/time calculations.

- **Aggregate Calculations** ‚Äì used to summarize or combine data from multiple rows, commonly for KPIs such as total absences or student GPA.

- **Logical Calculations** ‚Äì used to return results based on logical tests, typically for remarks such as *Pass* or *Fail*.

### üìà Key Results

‚úÖStreamlined the preparation of school forms, cutting processing time from 1 week to less than one day.<br> 
‚úÖEliminated 100% of data-entry errors, removing the need for manual cross-checks.<br>
‚úÖDelivered a practical, easy-to-use solution adopted by senior high school advisers for two consecutive school years.
